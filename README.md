# ForCodepathPitch
My own version



Hello! I am working alone as of now!
My pitch is for those who wish to nicely place all of their belongings
when moving.
I took this idea from my group's week 5 assignmet, as nobody seems to care anymore.

Please see that for the rest of the outline as I no longer have access to that Github.

Otherwise here are the slides:

and the gif showing how to use it with figma:

The video for the pitch is coming. I will notify Nathan as for that.
